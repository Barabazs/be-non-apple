# Belgian Azerty Keyboard Layout for MacOS

## [Reference](https://kbdlayout.info/KBDBE)

## About

This is a keyboard layout for the standard Belgian (Period) layout, which is very closely related to French Azerty layouts.
Since Apple does not recognize this keyboard layout, you have to install it yourself.

Changes in this fork:
- Change numpad separator to be . instead of ,

## Installation

- Place the `Belgian (period).keylayout` file in `/Library/Keyboard Layouts`
- Log out and back in
- Add it as an input source in system settings, it can be found under *Other*
